# NanoLisp
A mini version of my own lisp based programming language, built from scratch in C.
## Building One's Own Lisp in C
This repository documents a journey into learning C by creating a Lisp interpreter. It serves as a personal experiment to explore the fundamentals of C programming and language design through hands-on development.

## Why C?
C offers low-level control over system resources, providing insights into how computing systems work. It remains influential in modern operating systems and is an excellent choice for experimentation and learning.

## Why Lisp?
Lisp is celebrated for its simplicity and expressive power. Building a Lisp interpreter provides practical exposure to functional programming, symbolic computation, and language design principles.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository and follow the progress through commit history and documentation. This project captures experiments, challenges, and breakthroughs encountered along the way.

Happy coding, and enjoy the journey of creating something unique from the ground up!
